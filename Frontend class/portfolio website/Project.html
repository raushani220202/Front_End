      <h3>Railway track safety Alarm System</h3>
      <p>
        "My project focuses on developing an intelligent safety system to detect
        potential hazards on railway tracks, ensuring the safety of passengers,
        staff, and infrastructure. The system provides real-time alerts and
        warnings to prevent accidents and reduce risks."
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        "Railway accidents often result from track defects, obstruction, or
        human error. Existing systems rely on manual inspections, which can be
        time-consuming and ineffective. This project aims to automate track
        monitoring and alert authorities to potential dangers."

        <h3>Audio Denoising Signal</h3>
        <p>
            "My project focuses on developing algorithms and techniques to remove unwanted noise from audio signals, enhancing sound quality and clarity. The goal is to improve the intelligibility of speech and music, making it more pleasant to listen to."
        </p><br />
        <p>
           "Noise in audio signals can significantly degrade listening experiences. Background hiss, hum, or environmental noise can obscure important details, affecting audio quality. This project aims to address this issue."
